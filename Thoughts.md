Thoughts

Features: We discussed several potential features for your tool, including Vault Versioning, Environment Profiles, Integration with Other Tools, and Teams. We decided to focus on the core features first, and possibly add Teams later. We also discussed the possibility of creating extensions for Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ. Vault Versioning and Environment Profiles were considered but deemed not feasible due to similar constraints as the Teams feature.

Integration with Other Tools: This feature would involve providing an API that allows other tools to interact with your tool. We discussed the possibility of creating a REST API, a command-line interface, or a library that can be imported into other programs. We also discussed the need for security, as exposing an API could potentially make your tool more vulnerable to attacks.

Teams: We discussed the potential complexity and challenges of implementing a Teams feature, including the need for centralized control and coordination, and the potential for conflicts and inconsistencies. We decided to put this feature on hold for now.

IDE Extensions: We discussed the possibility of creating extensions for Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ. These extensions would use your tool's API to interact with the vault and provide a user-friendly interface for managing environment variables. We discussed the need for compatibility with a wide range of other tools and platforms, and the potential complexity of developing IDE extensions.

CLI Utility: We discussed the idea of creating a Command Line Interface (CLI) utility as a foundation for your IDE extensions. The CLI utility would allow users to interact with your tool directly from the command line, and could also be used by the IDE extensions to perform actions on the vault. We discussed the need for clear and helpful error messages, and the importance of testing the CLI utility to ensure it works correctly.

One-Time Sync: We discussed the possibility of a one-time sync feature, where a vault is sent over a wormhole and then becomes independent. We discussed the potential for out-of-sync variables between users, and the need for a strategy to handle this, such as an option for automatic updates.

Magic Wormhole: Magic Wormhole is a protocol for sending arbitrary-sized data from one computer to another. The sender generates a short, human-readable code that can be communicated over the phone or in person. The recipient enters this code into their own Magic Wormhole client, establishing a direct and secure connection between the two computers. We discussed using Magic Wormhole as a mechanism for sending the vault between users in a one-time sync scenario.

VS Code Extension Interaction with CLI: We discussed how a VS Code extension might interact with a CLI utility. We looked at an example of using Node.js's built-in child_process module to spawn a child process and run a command. We discussed the need for error handling and input validation in this context.
